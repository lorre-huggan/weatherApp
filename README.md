# \*\*Hugg Weather App

This project was built with React
using the [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io) Api

Styled with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

Animation with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

I built this app to show that I understand how to query and collect data from a API then take that data and render it to the dom using industry standard design principles.

I also wanted to show how I can render data dynamically based on user request and state of the application.

I used [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) as this makes the applications css easier to maintain and easy to dynamically style components. The readability of styled-components is also a big reason I like using this library.
